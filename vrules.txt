This game is a simulation of how a virus spreads from one person to
another. In the game, a red box indicates a person infected with the
virus and a white box indicates a person who does not have the virus.
Every time you press the right arrow button, it is counted as the next
day. Initially, in the simulation, each person starts off with some
random immunity levels. A few days after getting the virus they again
become virus-free(white box) with a new immunity level. Does the
spreading of virus ever come to an end? If so, when? This is the 
question the game tries to answer.
